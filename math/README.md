### Math and Trigonometric Functions

The Spreadsheet Math Functions perform many of the common mathematical calculations, including basic arithmetic, conditional sums & products, exponents & logarithms, and the trigonometric ratios. Mathematicians may also find the Spreadsheet Statistical Functions and Spreadsheet Engineering Functions useful.

The tables below list all the current built-in Microsoft Excel math functions, grouped into categories, to help you to find the function you need. Selecting a function will take you to a full description of the function, with examples of use and common errors.
